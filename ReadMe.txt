This is my submission for the Computational Physics assignment, written in Python.

Necessary modules can be found in the requirements.txt.

Each question has its own script related to it.  Their filenames start with "Q1_", "Q2_", etc.  myMatrixFunctions.py is also used in questions 2 and 3.
Simply run the script starting with "Q#_" for the relevant question.

All figures generated are saved to ./figures/.  I will include this folder in my submission so that it runs correctly.
There may be a few miscellaneous older figures or random diagrams in the folder which you can ignore.  They are just there
because it's the file my latex document points to for its figures.
